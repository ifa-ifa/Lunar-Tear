Extract files by enabling texture dumping in the config. Alternatively something like Replicant2Blender (https://github.com/WoefulWolf/Replicant2Blender) may be more useful. Then change them however you want and save them as dds images. New textures must have the same resolution, mipmap count, and compression format as the original. The last two can be found out by enabling File Info logging.
