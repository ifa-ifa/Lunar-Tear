You can create custom archives to mod any asset. For textures, this is superior to the old method of loose texture loading as it allows higher resolutions. It could also be used for otehr assets like meshes and animations, but no tools exist to create them.

This is very new and experimental, but here is a quick rundown for textures, copy pasted from a very late night discord message:

1) find the texture you want to modify and which pack it is in
the tool has a feature for that like this `UnsealedVerses.exe find-entry path/to/extracted/files/ kaine010_cloth1_mt.orm.rtex`
and it will tell you its in `chara/npc/kaine/kaine010/tex_kaine010`
2) then get the dds files for the texutres you want to alter in that pack, put them all in a folder, and "patch" the PACk like this: 
`UnsealedVerses.exe pack-patch .\tex_kaine010_mod .\tex_kaine010 'custom/textures'`
the textures in the custom textures folder needs to have the same name but with dds extension
e.g. put `kaine010_cloth_mt.n.dds` in the folder to replace `kaine010_cloth_mt.n.rtex` in the pack 
3) now youv got your `tex_kaine010_mod` with custom textures you create a folder structure similar to the original game. rename the modified file to the same as the original and put it in there
so create `customassets/chara/npc/kaine/kaine010/tex_kaine010` but the only file in `customassets/` should be your modded file(s)
then use `UnsealedVerses.exe archive mymod.arc customassets/ --index info.arc  --load-type 1`
4) using that command you will receive a `mymod.arc` and `info.arc`.
put them both in a folder and put that in lunar tears mod folder 
and that should hopefully be it
no need to manually patch info.arc anymore lunar tear will do it
